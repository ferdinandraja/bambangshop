## About this Project
In this repository, we have provided you a REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API project using Rocket web framework.

This project consists of four modules:
1.  `controller`: this module contains handler functions used to receive request and send responses.
    In Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, this is the Controller part.
2.  `model`: this module contains structs that serve as data containers.
    In MVC pattern, this is the Model part.
3.  `service`: this module contains structs with business logic methods.
    In MVC pattern, this is also the Model part.
4.  `repository`: this module contains structs that serve as databases and methods to access the databases.
    You can use methods of the struct to get list of objects, or operating an object (create, read, update, delete).

This repository provides a basic functionality that makes BambangShop work: ability to create, read, and delete `Product`s.
This repository already contains a functioning `Product` model, repository, service, and controllers that you can try right away.

As this is an Observer Design Pattern tutorial repository, you need to implement another feature: `Notification`.
This feature will notify creation, promotion, and deletion of a product, to external subscribers that are interested of a certain product type.
The subscribers are another Rocket instances, so the notification will be sent using HTTP POST request to each subscriber's `receive notification` address.

## API Documentations

You can download the Postman Collection JSON here: https://ristek.link/AdvProgWeek7Postman

After you download the Postman Collection, you can try the endpoints inside "BambangShop Publisher" folder.
This Postman collection also contains endpoints that you need to implement later on (the `Notification` feature).

Postman is an installable client that you can use to test web endpoints using HTTP request.
You can also make automated functional testing scripts for REST API projects using this client.
You can install Postman via this website: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

## How to Run in Development Environment
1.  Set up environment variables first by creating `.env` file.
    Here is the example of `.env` file:
    ```bash
    APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL="http://localhost:8000"
    ```
    Here are the details of each environment variable:
    | variable              | type   | description                                                |
    |-----------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|
    | APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL | string | URL address where this publisher instance can be accessed. |
2.  Use `cargo run` to run this app.
    (You might want to use `cargo check` if you only need to verify your work without running the app.)

## Your Reflections
This is the place for you to write reflections:

### Mandatory (Publisher) Reflections

#### Reflection Publisher-1
##### 1.
In this scenario, we don't need to use trait, because there is only one relationship. However, for other case where there are multiple implementations, employing traits would be better.

##### 2.
Using Vec is not appropriate, because it will allow the key to be duplicated. On the other hand, DashMap can be used to guarantee unique id and URL enforcement.

##### 3.
DashMap is essential in this context, especially in a multi-threaded application, because we need to ensured thread safety when accessing the SUBSCRIBERS variable.

#### Reflection Publisher-2
##### 1. 
We need to separate btoh service and repository is because they have different purpose in building a program. For service, they work on the businesses logic. On the other hand, repository works on the database.

##### 2.
If we only implement the model, the diffivulty of writing a code for a program will increase significantly, because we do everything in the model

##### 3.
Postman is great to help to test API. It is also great because it allows to manage cookies on a URL basis.

#### Reflection Publisher-3
##### 1.
In this case, the Push model is utilized. The evidence is in the presence of the notify function for subscriber notification.

##### 2.
The Pull model offers the advantage of subscribers retrieving data only when needed, mitigating the risk of receiving unnecessary data.On the other hand, the potential drawbacks include the possibility of using stale data, leading to logic errors and inconsistency.

##### 3.
If we don't use multi-threading, notifying subscribers individually would be necessary, therefore it will make the operations run longer and hampering the perfoemance.
